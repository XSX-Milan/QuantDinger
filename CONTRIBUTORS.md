## 🎯 Our Vision

**QuantDinger** is more than just a trading platform—it's a **community-driven ecosystem** built on the principles of **decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)** governance. We believe that the best products are built by the people, for the people.

As we embark on this journey to democratize quantitative trading and AI-powered market analysis, we're looking for passionate individuals who share our vision and want to help shape the future of decentralized finance.
